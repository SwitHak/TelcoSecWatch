## TWITTER THREAD - RESEARCH - VULNERABILITY - 0-click RCE via MMS in all modern Samsung phones (released 2015+), due to numerous bugs in a little-known custom "Qmage" image codec supported by Skia on Samsung devices.
- Good research, the exploitability is not likely to be.
- Despite it, I  think a bit about it and maybe we can monitor the exploitation by having some alert if the customers receives a lot of MMS in short time. Maybe we need to check the peak in historic databases.

## HUAWEI - Situation Point
### UK
- Parliamentary tried to pass an amendment to ban Huawei and they failed.
- MPs have narrowly voted down a Parliamentary amendment that would have banned Huawei altogether from the UK's 5G networks.
- The amendment, tabled by a number of rebel Conservative MPs from prime minister Boris Johnson's ruling party, was narrowly defeated by 306 votes to 282 – a majority of 24. The Conservatives currently hold a Parliamentary majority of 80.
- UK decision is contested, as we can read in the written evidence reports submitted to the Defence Sub-Committee, and Defence Committee.
- You can read the reports in full in the first source, read the summary Telecoms made or you can just read the headline, which summarizes well "Submissions to UK 5G security review are mostly hostile to Huawei"
- Despite this hard summary, I want to emphasize that the COVID-19 crisis we have is mentioned several times, and the numerous experts felt that China response or dependancy is kind of problematic.
- Some of them also stated that the British Governement should think about the threats and the conditioned aid from china were signals on how China could utilize the UK dependancy in 5G telecoms.
- According to reports, the White House has launched a wide-ranging review into the US relationship with the UK.
- One item in this review is the pursuit of intelligence missions on UK soil like having some of its spying planes (US RC-135s) in UK base Sufolk.
- Huawei also recruited Kris Hopkins as Senior Public Relations Manager for Huawei U.K.
- He was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office on 17 July 2016.
- There's also a lawsuit engaged against Huawei: Human rights activists seeking judicial review over Huawei 5G network deal, claim firm is linked to concentration camps, slavery and repression of minorities, source at the company insisted it complied with all laws on modern slavery

## INFORMATION - HUAWEI OR NOT HUAWEI WORK, THE HKSP case
- A developer who's going in Github in Organization at Huawei submitted a "first" contribution to Linux Kernel with the HKSP patchset.
- Rapidly, People behind GRSECURITY analyzed the contribution and found that the HKSP introduced a trivially exploitable vulnerability.
- Following that, the developper removed Huawei references, tried to explain it was only its work, but unsuccessfully.
- Even the HUAWEI PSIRT contacted the GRSECURITY asking them to change some information in their report.
- Some people talking about a backdoor, I will not take a part in this judgement, I only advise you to read the GRSECURITY report.

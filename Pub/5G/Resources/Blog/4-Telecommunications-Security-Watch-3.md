# Telecommunications Security Watch - 3

## RESEARCH - RCS - Mobile network hacking â€“ All-over-IP edition - SRLabs
- The RCS (Rich Communication Services) is an old standard of the IMS world born in 2007 by the GSMA.
- This standard recently became again a subject of interest when Google in June 2019 announced its intention to use it and deployed it.
- Researchers from SRLabs found some vulnerabilities inside of it like RCS messages intercepts, user tracking, sensitive information leaks, DDoS, etc.
- They're very clear on the fact that not all deployments are vulnerable, only some.

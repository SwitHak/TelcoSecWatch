# Telecommunications Security Watch - 2

## WARNING - Malicious domains registered
- Recently some domains have been registered with the goal to impersonate U.S. telecommunications vendors supports
- Publicly example: ciscosupports[.]com
- Beware of domains like this one, 5G related fraud increased recently

## RESEARCH - 5G - VULNERABILITY - 5GReasoner: A Property-Directed Security And Privacy Analysis Framework For 5G Cellular Network Protocol
- Attacks discovered by Syed Rafiul Hussain, Mitziu Echeverria, Imtiaz Karim, Omar Chowdhury, and Elisa Bertino
- Three categories of attacks:
  * Attacks on NAS Layer: DoS, over billing, service profiling, location tracking, downgrade from 5G, tracking, Atificial chaos & mass victimization
  * Attacks on the RRC Layer: DoS, SUPI catching, Force state change & battery draining
  * Cross layers attacks: Location Tracking, stealthy DoS, downgrade from 5G, artificial chaos & mass victimization
- Very interesting research, lacks of integrity in the messages is the most common root-cause of the vulnerabilities.
- GSMA acknowledged the vulnerabilities under the CVD-2019-0029

## RESEARCH - PATENT - SELECTIVE DISABLEMENT OF SIP ENCRYPTION FOR LAWFUL INTERCEPT
- Filled patent by AT&T ROSENBERG WILLIAM HARRY & JARDON MARIO MANUEL
- Abstract: "Systems and methods for selectively disabling encryption for user equipment are disclosed. A technique comprises interrogating a location code of a device authenticated to a network through an encrypted connection and determining whether the location code corresponds to an unencrypted region. If the location code does not correspond to an unencrypted region, the technique comprises registering the device to the network for communication using the encrypted connection. If the location code corresponds to an unencrypted region, the technique comprises sending an intercept challenge to the device to re-authenticate the device to the network, the intercept challenge including parameters to establish an unencrypted connection, receiving re-registration information including unencrypted location information from the device using the unencrypted connection, and registering the device to the network using the unencrypted connection."

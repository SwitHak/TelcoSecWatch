##### I.
- Is subject to authorization by the Prime Minister, in 
to preserve the interests of defence and national security, the operation on national territory of devices, i.e. any hardware or software devices, enabling the connection of end-user terminals to the mobile radio network, with the exception of fourth generation and earlier generation networks, which, by virtue of their functions, present a risk to the permanence, integrity, security, availability of the network, or to the confidentiality of the messages transmitted and information related to communications, excluding end-user installed equipment or equipment dedicated exclusively to an independent network, passive or non-configurable electronic equipment and non-specialised hardware devices incorporated in the equipment.
- The authorization mentioned in the first paragraph of this I is only required for the operation, directly or through third party suppliers, of equipment by the operators mentioned in Article L. 1332-1 of the French Defence Code, thus designated by virtue of their activity as operators of an electronic communications network open to the public.
- The list of equipment whose operation is subject to the authorization mentioned in the first paragraph of this I is set by Decree of the Prime Minister, issued after obtaining the opinion of the French Regulatory Authority for Electronic Communications and Postal Services (Autorité de régulation des communications électroniques et des postes). This list lists the various devices concerned with reference to the terminology used in the international standards associated with fifth and subsequent generation mobile radio networks.

##### II.
- Authorization to operate a device may be granted after examination of an application for authorization submitted by the operator. The file shall specify the models and versions of the equipment for which authorization is sought.
- The authorization shall be granted, where appropriate subject to conditions, for a maximum period of eight years. The renewal of the authorization shall be the subject of a renewal application file, which shall be submitted at least two months before the expiry of the authorization in force.
- The terms and conditions for granting the authorization, the conditions that may be attached to it and the composition of the authorization application file and the renewal application file are set by decree of the Council of State, after obtaining the opinion of the Regulatory Authority for Electronic Communications and Postal Services and the Higher Commission for Digital and Postal Services, which give their decision within one month of the date of referral to them.
- NOTE: In accordance with Article 3 of Act No. 2019-810 of 1 August 2019: This article is applicable to the operation of the equipment mentioned in I of Article L. 34-11 of the French Post and Electronic Communications Code installed since 1 February 2019.

# Commentary
## Laws
- By setting by laws an offical regulation framework for 5G, France taken a hard foot against Mobile Networks Operators and not making a strong point on the question every French MNO is concerned : Is Huawei allowed in French Networks ?
- When everyone focussed on this answer, the French Federation of Telecoms (FFT) argued / warned several times this year that an answer to this question could benefits to Nokia and Ericsson and consequently, they could rise up the price of 5G equipment.
- Interesting part, the French Authorities didn't choose the easier way for the French MNO, each of them must filed a request for all of 5G equipments (1 equipment + 1 Software version -> 1 request) installed since February 2019, the Prime Minister services must answer to them under two months, if they doesn't get an answer, the default answer is the equipment must be removed.
- French MNO aren't quite sastified by this move, one time they even considered to contest the law on the French Constitutional Council.
- Their last move is interesting, they will submit requests for Huawei, Nokia & Ericsson equipments and see the anwsers.

## Technical
- These laws prohibits the usage of a supplier inside the MNO operators networks.
- If at the first read, we can think, we stills can choose, at the second read you will understand that the French MNO, they don't really have more the choice.
- They must comply to the french law, so if one, let's say RAN equipment can't be installed cause the XXXX supplier isn't allowed in this area, the MNO need to have a core network under another equipment to fullfil the regulations requirements.
- Some thoughts:
  * MNO deploy at least 2 different suppliers in their networks, having two technologies and having sometimes the same functions duplicated but under anaother supplier, this option will cost lot of money.
  * MNO deploy by geographical locations, waiting all answers for area AREA1 and if one supplier isn't allowed, deploy with the other one, will delay the 5G deployment but it's deployment cost-savings.
  * MNO deploy an authorized supplier on all the MNO 5G networks, will cost more, permissions time saving, security risks (one supplier SPOF).
  * MNO don't take the regulations in their deployments, do what they want
  * MNO deploy contest the recent laws (Stills an option regarding the actual context)
 
- Some schema show you which network functions are concerned by the above law:
